"""stdin → verdict → exit code. The hook entry point, for both hosts.

THE LIFECYCLE

    SessionStart / first PreToolUse
        Load the declaration. Fingerprint the tree. Run the project's checks and
        store the findings. This is the baseline, and it is ephemeral — captured
        immediately before the agent acts, never committed, discarded on prune.

    PreToolUse
        Cheap pre-emptive gate. When the tool names a path outright (Write, Edit,
        MultiEdit, NotebookEdit) and that path is outside the declaration, block it
        before it happens — exit 2, which survives `bypassPermissions` on both
        hosts. Bash is deliberately NOT parsed; guessing which files a shell command
        will touch is exactly the guesswork this tool refuses to do. Those writes are
        caught by the scan instead.

    PostToolUse
        Record what was touched, for attribution. On Codex this can also block; on
        Claude Code it cannot ("tool already ran"), so nothing here is load-bearing.

    Stop
        The gate. Rescan, diff against the baseline, re-run the checks, subtract
        pre-existing findings, emit a verdict. On `deny`, refuse to let the agent
        stop and hand it the report so it can fix what it did.

ABSOLUTE INVARIANT — inherited from agent-guard, and it is not negotiable

    A wroteonly bug must never wedge a session.

    Every entry point is wrapped in a bare `except BaseException` that exits 0. A
    verification wrapper that takes down the agent it was verifying has done more
    damage than the write it was looking for. The one thing that is allowed to stop
    a run is a violated declaration — a decision, not a crash.

    The single exception is `WROTEONLY_STRICT=1`, which turns an internal error into
    a block. Unattended jobs that would rather halt than proceed unverified can set
    it; the default cannot.
