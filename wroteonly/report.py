"""The diff, and the verdict it produces.

Brings the three pieces together: what was declared (declare), what actually
happened (observe), what newly broke (baseline) — and reduces them to one
ACS-shaped decision plus a report a human can read without a decoder ring.

DECISION TABLE

    condition                                        decision   reason
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    wrote/deleted a path matching `forbid`           deny       forbidden_path
    wrote a path outside the declaration             deny       undeclared_write
    deleted a path outside the declaration           deny       undeclared_delete
    new checker findings absent from the baseline    warn*      new_errors
    declared a path and never wrote it               warn*      declared_but_unwritten
    nothing declared, but writes happened            escalate   no_declaration
    clean                                            allow      clean

    * escalates to `deny` under `fail_direction: closed`, because on a closed
      posture "something broke and I cannot prove it was pre-existing" is not a
      thing to wave through.

    Composition is most-restrictive-wins (verdict.worst) — the house pattern, and
    XACML's `deny-overrides`.

WHY `escalate` FOR A MISSING DECLARATION
    "The agent never said what it would do" is not the same failure as "the agent
    did something it didn't say." The first means the tool was not driven properly
    and a human should look; the second means the agent exceeded its brief. Folding
    them together would make every un-instrumented run look like a violation, and
    the tool would be turned off within a week.

INVARIANT
    Every path in the evidence is relative to the run root and POSIX-separated, so a
    report is diffable across machines. Nothing here re-reads the filesystem; it
    operates only on what the observers already recorded.
